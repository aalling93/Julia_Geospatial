Examples for a blog series on Geospatial Julia using ArchGDAL

## Imagery

Isle_Wight.tif is a sample image to be used in some of these scripts. It is a 10m spatial resolution RGB Sentinel 2a image from 2017 (May i think). I have preprocessed it as performed a 99% clip stretch on the data. This was done in Python using Rasterio, but should be possible in ArchGDAL as well.
